# WOTO Time

### NOTE: While this program is functional, this is intended as a joke. Don't skip class.

Alerts you when Professor Astrachan has opened up a WOTO.

## Background

On the first day of 201, ola was explaining WOTOs. Quoth he,

> Of course, you could just have a friend go to class instead of you, and whenever there's a WOTO, he could just text you... \*pause for dramatic effect\* **WOTO TIME.**

So of course, being a computer scientist, my mission is to *automate algorithmic processes that scale*. So I automated WOTO notifications, scaled to every single WOTO.


## Usage

* Configure everything in the `config.ini` file.
* Make sure you have Python 3 installed
* Run `python wototime.py` or `python3 wototime.py`, whichever your computer uses for Python 3

You'll need to provide your gmail email and password in order to get the SMS notifications. No, I'm not stealing your password; read the code if you don't believe me.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Make sure not to accidentally push your `config.ini` with actual credentials in it ;)
